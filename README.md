I am making a game with similar mechanics like surio.io
This project is mainly for me to understand different aspects of 2D game development
The project will become cooler as time passes.
I am using assets from kenny.nl and from the surio.io game. 
I don't own any asset used in the game and I don't intend to earn any money from it.
