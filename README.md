I am making a mobile game with similar mechanics like surio.io

This project is made to learn different aspects of 2D game development in Unity. 

The project will become cooler as time passes.
I am using assets from kenny.nl and from the surio.io game. 

I don't own any asset used in the game and I don't intend to earn any money from it.
